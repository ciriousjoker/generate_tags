# Generate Tags

Generates tags based on the parameters.

This works by rendering the html/css inside Puppeteer (headless chrome engine) and screenshotting it.
This vastly improves recreation speed if something changes (color, margins etc.) and allows you to use the webstack for styling.

## Usage

- `npm install`
- `npm run generate`

## Prerequisites

- NodeJS
